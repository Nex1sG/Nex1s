My personal auditory
“
I’m an ITMO University student studying Robotics and Control Systems,
and I’m creating a GitHub account to connect with other students, share projects,
 and access educational resources. I’m hoping to utilize the GitHub Student Developer Pack 
to gain access to essential software tools and grow my skills in this exciting field. ITMO and GitHub forever!
